# To Run the automation flow and generate .html report,
Command: python test_suite.py --browser <browser_name> --report <report_name>
eg. python test_suite.py --browser firefox --report tppFlow

# To send the generated report via email,
Command:  python sendEmail.py


Here,
    browser_name = Either chrome, firefox or edge
    report_name = You can give any name that you want to give to the generated report file


Note -> Here the recommended browser is firefox. Because, other browsers may give privacy errors. With firefox this error
        occurs only once and once validated this won't bother any.
